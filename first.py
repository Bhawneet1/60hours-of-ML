# AI<ML<DL(Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning is a subset of machine learning)
# Artificial intelligence is a field concerned with building smart and intelligent Machines
#  Machine learning is a technique to impliment AI that can learn from data themselves without explicitly being coded  
# Deep learning is subfield of ML that learn from the Aritificial neural networks

# type of machine learning 
# 1.Supervised-when ml algo learn from labelled data(eg if we train with labelled data of mango and bananas then it can identify during testing)
# 2.Unsupervised-ml algo learn from unlabelled data(eg if we give the mangos and bananas unlabelled then it with convert them in two groups)
# 3.Reinforcement-how agent takes action in environment to maximize reward

# components of reinfrocement learning
# 1.Environment
# 2.Agent
# 3.Action
# 4.Reward
# eg make a chess bot that can play chess 
# environment-chessboard
# agent-computer
# action-computer takes actions
# reward-for each step it takes closer to winning will get +ve reward if wrong move then -ve reward
